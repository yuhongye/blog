#### You don't *pull* things out of a map, you *declare* that you need them

这就是Dependency Injection的本质。If you need something, you don't go out and get it from somewhere, or even ask a class to return you something. Instead, you simply declare that you can't do your work without it, and rely on someone else to give you what you need.

This model is backwards from how most people think about code: it's a more *declarative* model rather than an *imperative* one.
